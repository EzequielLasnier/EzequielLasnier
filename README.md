My work operates at the intersection of **Physical Computing**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Pedagogy**. I specialize in translating complex engineering concepts into accessible, tangible narratives. 

Currently I focus on **Phygital Experiences**, **Edge AI**, and **Alt-Ctrl** interfaces to empower the next generation of creators. Currently exploring the boundaries between human physiology and digital systems.

## Core Research Components

I treat my research lines as modular components of a larger educational architecture.

| Component (Project) | Status | Architecture / Stack | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **[Sabio Huesos AI](https://github.com/EzequielLasnier/sabio-huesos-ai-tutor)** | `v1.0` | `Python` `RAG` `Gemini` | **Socratic Tutor Engine.** A specialized LLM implementation that fosters critical thinking using RAG to reduce hallucinations in educational contexts. |
| **[Affective Echo](https://github.com/EzequielLasnier/affective-echo-edge-ai)** | `Beta` | `TinyML` `C++` `Edge Impulse` | **Privacy-First Wellbeing.** On-device audio classification system for real-time emotional feedback without cloud dependency. |
| **[Phygital Bridge](https://github.com/EzequielLasnier/phygital-bridge-alt-ctrl)** | `v1.0` | `Micro:bit` `Serial` `Python` | **Alt-Ctrl Middleware.** A bridge protocol turning physical objects and bio-signals into inputs for game engines and digital narratives. |
